# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remoce or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
Make the website we can, preferably A+ quality, while also satisfying the client.

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
- We will complete our work based on the agreed upon deadlines, and if that is not possible we will communicate that beforehand.
- We will try our best in every section of the code we are assigned.
- We will be clear and responsive when planning group meetings.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We have a text groupchat. We will meet bi-weekly, based on the deadlines we set for ourself we may add more meetings.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

We will communicate with her through email and Zoom or Skype.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)
James: Scheduling, organization, client contact  
Eva: documenting in the design journey
Maddie: evaluating the design of the website, finding users
Nicole: second client contact

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We will hold each other accountable through reminders in the group chat. As long as everything is communicated early enough we think there shouldn't be issues.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
Majority vote, and if its a tie make a compromise of some kind.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
If issues arise we will plan a meeting to discuss changes to the contract.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
If we hit goals early we rewards ourseleves with food. 


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
